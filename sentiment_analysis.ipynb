Lexicon-Based Scoring:</b> VADER uses a pre-built lexicon (dictionary) of words with associated sentiment scores ranging from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive). It also includes intensity modifiers to account for sentiment strength.\n","\n","<b>2. Polarity Detection:</b> The algorithm analyzes text considering individual words, phrases, and context. It detects positive and negative sentiment indicators, neutral words, and handles:\n","- *Polarity Shifting:* Recognizes when words modify nearby words' sentiments, e.g., \"not good\" is negative due to \"not.\"\n","- *Negations:* Identifies negations that reverse sentiments, e.g., \"don't like\" is negative due to \"don't.\"\n","- *Amplifiers and Dampeners:* Accounts for intensifiers (e.g., \"extremely good\") and dampeners in sentiment assessment.\n","- *Exclamation Marks and Punctuation:* Considers punctuation, especially exclamation marks, as indicators of sentiment intensity.\n","- *Capitalization:* Acknowledges capitalization's impact on sentiment intensity.\n","- *Emojis and Emoticons:* Recognizes and interprets these symbols for sentiment analysis.\n","\n","<b>3. Sentiment Intensity:</b> VADER assesses intensity using capitalization, punctuation, and other features.\n","\n","<b>4. Compound Score:</b> After analysis, VADER generates a compound sentiment score between -1 and 1:\n","    Compound score > 0: Positive Sentiment\n","    Compound score < 0: Negative Sentiment\n","    Compound score = 0: Neutral Sentiment"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RAlKXbKqvCL5"},"source":["<b> Note: </b> For VanderSentiment Analysis no splitting of data is required because no model is trained.To compare the results with the following approaches the test data is used."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":56,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":43,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703292867543,"user":{"displayName":"Max Greger","userId":"14066473361963151085"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"snY-pqWUvCL6"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Function to map compound score to a rating scale (1-5)\n","\n","def map_sentiment_score_to_rating(compound_score):\n","    if compound_score >= 0.6:\n","        return 5\n","    elif compound_score >= 0.2:\n","        return 4\n","    elif compound_score >= -0.2:\n","        return 3\n","    elif compound_score >= -0.6:\n","        return 2\n","    else: # compound_score < -0.6\n","        return 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":57,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":441,"status":"ok","timestamp":1703292867942,"user":{"displayName":"Max Greger","userId":"14066473361963151085"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"yKb7-NJDvCL7","outputId":"90537f74-c807-462c-fba8-f29b7e4c30ae"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["<ipython-input-57-15e2f3f4c611>:6: FutureWarning: The default dtype for empty Series will be 'object' instead of 'float64' in a future version.

It demonstrated decent recall, precision, and F1 score, indicating its ability to capture sentiment to some extent.\n","\n","*Already Trained Model:*  The use of an already trained model resulted in the best performance among the three approaches. It achieved an accuracy of 61.25% and demonstrated higher recall, precision, and F1 score, suggesting its effectiveness in sentiment analysis.\n","\n","*Fine-tuned Small BERT:* The fine-tuned small BERT model showed the lowest performance with an accuracy of 17.25%. It had the lowest recall, precision, and F1 score, indicating that further adjustments or hyperparameter tuning may be needed.\n","\n","**Recommendations:**\n","\n","*Choose the Already Trained Model:* The \"Already Trained Model\" approach outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and overall sentiment analysis metrics. I recommend to adopt this approach for predicting restaurant review sentiments.\n","\n","*Improve Fine-tuned BERT:* I suggest to explore if further improvements could be achieved. This can include additional fine-tuning iterations, adjusting hyperparameters, or considering a larger BERT model. Also training the model with more data could be useful to improve the performance.\n","\n","**Suggestions for Future Improvements:**\n","\n","*Data Augmentation:* Collecting more diverse and extensive restaurant review data could improve the performance of the self trained model.\n","\n","*Hyperparameter Tuning:* Continue experimenting with different hyperparameter settings, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization algorithms, could lead to better model performance.\n","\n","*Sentiment Analysis for Title and Text:* Currently, both title and text are used for sentiment analysis. Using only one of them could lead to better results. \n","\n","*User Feedback Loop:* Utilize user feedback and continuously update the model to adapt to changing customer sentiments and language trends."]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"A100","provenance":[{"file_id":"1pAJ0S5AmGusoZgyhoHQe0vR5e3CuzD9A","timestamp":1703290643723}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
